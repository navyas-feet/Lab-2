    "### Salary Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When analyzing the annual salary data, we can conclude that the minimum salary for the staff of the City of Phoenix is 767 dollars annually, a number that shocked me immensely. Objectively, that is not a livable salary which makes me wonder about the age and profession of the worker. It also makes me wonder whether or not that was a typo because 767 dollars/year is far too low for any adult to survive, especially in a major city like Phoenix. \n",
    "\n",
    "* We can also conclude that the maximum annual salary is 314,999.36 dollars/year which is a stark contrast to the minimum salary. The difference is shocking and makes me wonder even more whether or not the minimum salary was an accidental mistype by the data collectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "* We can also conclude that the mode annual salary is 72,425.60 dollars/year which means that this is the most common wage among the Seattle City Staff. An interesting area for exploration would be to see whether or not the jobs with the same salaries are the same or are within the same department. \n",
    "\n",
    "* We can also conclude that the mean annual salary of a Phoenix City employee is 65,390 dollars/year. An interesting question to explore comes from the root that outliers can affect the mean. I doubt the effect can be much in a dataset with a much values as this one, however, I am still curious to find out what the mean would be without the value of 767 dollars/year and how much this would effect the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The median annual salary, as concluded from the calculations is 63,315 dollars/year,a number that is incredibly close to the mean. This makes me wonder whether there are many salaries within the 60,000 dollar range in order for the number range to effect both the mean as well as the median. "

    "### Questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* This lab makes me wonder more about the minimum annual salary for the City of Phoenix. Due to the fact that the yearly minimum is 767 dollars, it makes me wonder more about the age, gender and department of the person earning so little. I wonder if the person is a minor and, I wonder if they are working half time or full time. \n",
    "* I would also like to know more about the gender statistics in the City of Phoenix staff. I would like to know more about which gender is more prevalent in which department and, which gender makes more money on average would also be interesting to find out. This also brings me to question whether there are options for the staff member to identify as non-binary or not, as this particular fact could tell us a lot about the culture of Phoenix versus the culture of Seattle. \n",
    "* Finally, I would like to study the highest and lowest annual wages again, especially to find out if individuals in the same or similar departments make similiar amounts of money. This could also help me to find out whether or not the number for minimum wage is a mistype or not, depending on what the salaries are of individuals with similar jobs. "
